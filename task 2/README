README – Task 2: Secure File Exchange Using RSA + AES

Overview This task demonstrates a hybrid encryption process where Alice
sends a protected file to Bob using AES-256 for file encryption and
RSA-2048 for securing the AES key. This version intentionally shows an
integrity check failure, meaning the decrypted file does not match the
original.

Process Explanation 1. Bob Generates RSA Keys Bob creates an RSA key
pair: - public.pem – shared with Alice - private.pem – kept secret

2.  Alice Creates a Plaintext File Alice writes her message into
    alice_message.txt.

3.  Alice Generates AES-256 Key and IV Alice creates a 32‑byte AES key
    and a 16‑byte IV.

4.  Alice Encrypts the File Using AES-256 The file is encrypted and
    stored as encrypted_file.bin.

5.  Alice Encrypts the AES Key Using RSA The AES key is encrypted with
    Bob’s public key and stored as aes_key_encrypted.bin.

6.  Bob Decrypts the AES Key Bob uses his private key to recover the AES
    key.

7.  Bob Decrypts the Encrypted File Bob produces decrypted_message.txt.

8.  Integrity Verification (Intentional FAIL) The SHA‑256 hash of
    alice_message.txt does not match the hash of decrypted_message.txt.
    INTEGRITY CHECK: FAIL

AES vs RSA – Comparison AES: fast, ideal for large data. RSA: slow,
ideal for encrypting keys. Hybrid encryption combines the strengths of
both.

Deliverables - alice_message.txt - encrypted_file.bin -
aes_key_encrypted.bin - decrypted_message.txt (modified or altered) -
public.pem - private.pem - README.txt
